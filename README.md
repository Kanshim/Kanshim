Simon Kanka is a PhD student at the Physics department of the University of Pisa. His research is focused on acoustic physics applied to tyre road noise to evaluate the surface course of rubberized asphalt. Simon has obtained his master degree in theoretical physics at the Univerisity of Pisa in the field of quantum gravity. The master thesis discussion title was "Effective description of fluid membranes and quantum gravity". He also partecipated in the TRIM project to classify acoustic comfort inside ships with classical acoustic measurements and the use of the acoustic camera.

At the moment he is working on:
- Tyre Cavity Noise measured with a specific Tyre Cavity Microphone to study the acoustic properties of tyres for the exterior noise;
- Tyre Cavity Microphone as a way to classify different pavements by means of the standard pavement indexes;
- Close ProXimity Methods acoustic measurements, surface pavement laser measurements to establish a model to highlight the lifetime of asphal rubberized pavements.
